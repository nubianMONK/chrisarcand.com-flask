==================

My personal website, version 4: Using the Flask microframework (Python).

MongoEngine models very loosely based on Ross Lawley's flask-tumblelog (https://github.com/rozza/flask-tumblelog)

TBD: Instructions for running locally (if you're interested). For now, know that you need pip and a virtualenv 
with all of the requirements in requirements.pip, along with a running instance of MongoDB. I use gunicorn in
production but you can run Flask's development server locally by using <code>python manage.py runserver</code>
(Make sure 'python' is the Python from your virtualenv...)
